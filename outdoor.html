                <h1 class="ham-info">Outdoor Adventure</h1>
                <p>Something very unique happens when some of Canada’s most beloved natural landscapes run right through
                    a region’s cities and towns. Getting out and exploring becomes second nature. That translates into
                    activities like yoga classes on the Niagara Escarpment, date night paddles down the Grand River,
                    snow shoeing under the light of the moon along the Bruce Trail and a shoreline cycling route dotted
                    with amazing restaurants and patios. When you’re ready for a new breed of outdoor adventures that
                    don’t require a four-hour car ride to reach, Hamilton Halton Brant will be waiting for you.</p>

                <h2>Westfield Heritage Village</h2>
                <p>While the historic buildings at this living history museum remain closed, this 130-hectare site in
                    the country is open to visitors looking for a charming, rural escape. The area is bordered by
                    beautiful woodlands, meadows and trails, perfect for peaceful hikes.</p>

                <h2>Tiffany Falls</h2>
                <p>Enjoy a short but beautiful hike over bridges and streams through the forest with a great payoff in
                    the end. After a short ten minute walk, you'll come to a 21-metre cascade waterfall with cliffs on
                    either side. Please be sure to enjoy the view from the safety of the viewing platform. There’s
                    access to the Bruce Trail for a longer hike, but the ease of visiting this beautiful waterfall is
                    part of the charm for those looking for a short hike with no time for complaints.</p>

                <h2>Devil's Punchbowl</h2>
                <p>Formed millions of years ago on the Niagara escarpment, this multi-coloured gorge is a fascinating
                    history lesson in geology. Look over the cliff from above, or up from below – both offer fascinating
                    views. The 11.5 km Dofasco 2000 Trail begins here and leads to the Vinemount Wetland swamp forest
                    featuring several bird species.</p>
                <h2>Waterfront Trail</h2>
                <p>Catch some rays along the Hamilton waterfront as you follow the paved trails west from Pier 8 to Pier
                    4 and onto Bayfront Park. Along the way, you’ll stumble on plenty of food options, places to stop
                    and play, and photo-worthy landscapes. The paved paths are easy to follow.</p>

                <h2>Hamilton Waterfalls</h2>
                <p>The city of Hamilton in Ontario, Canada is home to more than 100 waterfalls and cascades, most of
                    which are on or near the Bruce Trail as it winds through the Niagara Escarpment. Ontario's
                    internationally recognized Niagara Escarpment provides perfect geological conditions for waterfalls
                    to occur, from Tobermory to Niagara Falls.</p>
                <p>The most scenic waterfall in Hamilton is Webster's Falls. With its 30 metres (98 ft) crest, it is
                    the largest waterfall within the city. Tew's Falls is a 41 metres (135 ft) ribbon waterfall, and is
                    the tallest waterfall found in Hamilton. Both Webster's and Tew's are located at the Spencer Gorge /
                    Webster's Falls Conservation Area. Albion Falls was once seriously considered as a possible source
                    of water for Hamilton. Rocks from the Albion Falls area were used in the construction of the Royal
                    Botanical Gardens' Rock Garden.
