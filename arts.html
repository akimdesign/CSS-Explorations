                <h2>A Pillar for Arts Since 1914</h2>
                <p>With over 10,000 works in its permanent collection, the AGH is the oldest and largest museum in
                    southwestern Ontario. The gallery opened its doors in 1914 with 33 paintings by William Blair Bruce
                    as its first exhibit.</p>
                <p>Formerly called the Municipal Gallery of Hamilton, the AGH was housed in the Hamilton Public Library
                    on James Street South where it lived for 33 years. The paintings known as the “Bruce Collection”
                    formed the foundation of the gallery’s permanent collection. Its second location, in West Hamilton
                    (close to McMaster University), was opened in 1953.</p>
                <p>The AGH’s current downtown location opened in 1977. Now a hub for education and community programming
                    in addition to changing collections and exhibitions, the AGH is the perfect spot for out-of-town
                    visitors, date night, a family outing, or a solo trip for the art-lover. Its programming includes
                    tours, workshops, clubs, family events, films, and more.</p>
