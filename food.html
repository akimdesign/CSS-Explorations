                <p>Chew on this! If meals, snacks and beverages take centre stage in your Instagram pics and travel
                    photo albums, it’s time to plan a food-filled frolic in Hamilton Halton Brant. From downtown
                    Hamilton’s hipster hotspots to cool craft breweries, under-the-radar wineries, farm markets and
                    more, there are countless delicious ways to fuel your way through the day.</p>

                <h2>Hamilton Farmer's Market</h2>
                <p>The Hamilton Farmers’ Market has long been a favourite local destination. But with a quickly
                    developing ‘food hall’ and innovative new vendors, it’s fast becoming a must-see attraction for
                    visitors too. </p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Hamilton Farmers’ Market was established in 1837 making Hamilton home to one of the oldest
                    farmers markets in Ontario.
                    After a fire at the Market Hall in 1917, makeshift shelters were erected, creating an open-air
                    market considered the largest in Canada for the first half of the 20th century.</p>
                <p>Urban renewal eventually moved the market back indoors and to its current location.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="food_box food_box__5">

                <p>A major renovation in 2011 modernized the market and brought a cherished historic landmark back to
                    life. The two-story tall Birks Clock which once hung outside the old Birks Jewellery store at the
                    corner of King and James Streets (south side of Gore Park), now hangs as a proud centre-piece above
                    the stalls of the market.</p>

                <h2>Nique</h2>
                <p>Nique is now open for brunch on Sundays! This popular and colourful downtown eatery is the place for
                    Tator Tot lovers – they come smashed on top of Breakfast Sandwiches or on the side of your Steak &
                    Eggs. A crowd favorite is their Chicken and Waffles but check out their Squaffle (squash waffle) or
                    new items like their middle-eastern inspired Shakshuka dish (eggs poached in tomato sauce). If you
                    can’t choose, my personal go-to is the “Hungry Human Hangover”. Built for sharing, this brunch dish
                    for has it all: – fried chicken, hanger steak, sausage and bacon.</p>

                    favourite north-end haunt, check out the video for People's Champ by Hamilton's The Arkells (but

                <h2>Saint James Espresso Bar & Eatery</h2>
                <p>Don’t be surprised if there’s a line up on the weekend as this James Street North hotspot is very
                    popular! And with good reason. This snug cafe offers a delicious rotating menu for brunch on
                    weekends. I suggest their ‘Drive thru’ breakfast sandwich (only $6 and you won’t be disappointed)
                    and their famous Short Stack pancakes – the flavor changes every weekend (think cinnabon, lemon
                    ricotta and apple crumble). Get a delicious preview by checking out their drool-worthy Instagram.
